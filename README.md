# Project : Papashan's Rising

## Description
This project is a little demo for a Rogue-like game made in Python that I started during my last year in high school.

Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to finish it, so it is just a "bit" playable.  

But I am currently working on a remake of this project on Unity to finally finish it and make it fully playable.

## How to use
1) Execute `main.py`
2) When in game :
   - ZQSD : directional inputs
   - E : interact
   - Space (hold) : admin mode
   - Up/Down/Left/Right arrows : debug functionality to move a skeleton
